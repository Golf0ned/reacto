basics of this dir is that the uploader takes over your mouse with hardcoded values for x and y positions of where the upload button and renaming files are for the bot emoji upload on the discord dev page

I should honestly figure out how to like have it go through a setup portion to mark the values before beginning but for now to recreate just run the poll position function which prints the mouse position to find where you want the mouse to move to and then run the file

Once done the parser expects the html for each of the pages of all emojis, ie just go and hit copy html for each page and paste them into html/p1.html then it will parse them for key value pairs and dumps them into the yaml file.
