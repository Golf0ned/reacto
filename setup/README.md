basics of this dir is that we poll for where the positions of mouse should be for uploader on the bot page by hovering over upload button and then over the renaming for the file then make sure the upload button folder navs to the assets of this repo rest will be taken care of by script when run


once uploading is all done 
for parser have inspect element open and find the div that highlights the table of emoji, uploaded by, emoji id take note of that. now scroll to the bottom of the page and start the parser script. it will prompt you to be hover over the position on the screen of the div you found earlier then the next button mark those two the rest the bot will take care of
